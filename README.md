# RadGPT

AbdomenAtlas 3.0 is the first public dataset with high quality abdominal CTs and paired radiology reports. The database includes more than 9,000 CT scans with radiology reports and per-voxel annotations of liver, kidney and pancreatic tumors.

Moreover, we present RadGPT, a segmentation-based report generation model which significantly surpasses the current state of the art in report generation for abdominal CTs.

Model and dataset to be released here very soon, stay tuned!
